External libraries are out of scope. But are issues that arise from how the in-scope contracts make use of external libraries in scope?

@GainsGoblin hello, had a question about the `Position` contract.

Inside `updateFunding()`, what does the boolean value in the `accInterestPerOi` denote? Is it the long vs short Oi (i.e false = short, true = long)?

For reference:
```
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => mapping(bool => int256)))
    private accInterestPerOi;

function updateFunding(
    // ...
) external onlyMinter {
        if (longOi[_asset][_tigAsset] > 0) {
            accInterestPerOi[_asset][_tigAsset][true] +=
                ((((int256(
                    block.timestamp - lastUpdate[_asset][_tigAsset]
                ) * fundingDeltaPerSec[_asset][_tigAsset]) * 1e18) /
                    int256(longOi[_asset][_tigAsset])) *
                    int256(1e10 - vaultFundingPercent[_asset][_tigAsset])) /
                1e10;
        }
        // ...
    } else if (longOi[_asset][_tigAsset] > shortOi[_asset][_tigAsset]) {
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```


[12/11/2022 16:08] gainsgoblin
yes, its long and short


[12/11/2022 16:08] faithxia

[12/12/2022 06:58] Franfran#5067
Answer from the sponsor:
"How the referral fee works is that the referrer earns the ref fee and the trader gets a fee discount as well. For this reason the subtraction has to be doubled, to prevent extra minting."

Don’t use the deployments folder in the auditing process, as the source code of the deployments is different from the code currently being audited.

Is this a onetime deal or forever?


[12/12/2022 16:52] gainsgoblin
The referral? Once a trader is referred, they are referred forever.


[12/12/2022 19:27] chaduke#3730
ok, what about the benefit of referral fee and discount for trader?

This was the proposal for locking, which explains the concept at a high level. BondNFT is the receipt NFT you get for locking.

May I ask in what roles the layerZero protocol play in the Tigris trading?


[12/14/2022 19:07] ladboy233
I see that Tigris trading is multi-chain.


[12/14/2022 19:07] ladboy233
Are each blockchain's smart contract independent between each other?


[12/14/2022 19:07] ladboy233
There is no cross-chain request?


[12/14/2022 19:07] gainsgoblin
Only bridging GovNFT


[12/14/2022 19:07] ladboy233
Oh ok. Which is out of scope for this contest.


[12/14/2022 19:07] gainsgoblin
It's not


[12/14/2022 19:08] gainsgoblin
GovNFT.sol is in scope


[12/14/2022 19:08] ladboy233
AH ok


[12/14/2022 19:08] ladboy233

[12/14/2022 19:17] faithxia
@GainsGoblin out of curiosity, who is the owner of the `Trading` contract? Is it the `GovNFT` contract?


[12/14/2022 19:28] faithxia
I checked the deployment of the contract on Polygon, and looks like its a multisig Gnosis wallet, is that right? Or rather, does that apply to all chains these contracts will be deployed on?


[12/14/2022 19:29] gainsgoblin
Yes its a multisig

Seems like for h-08 176 would be the 30% share bonus for best report and 133 is the base. I don't see 230

Not untill all the issues are mitigated by the sponsors. Else we would be in a position announcing the zero day vulns for the projects.
